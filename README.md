This program is a simple tool to translate PPM P3 files to PPM P6, and vice versa.
Download the .c file, the makefile, and one or both .ppm files into a chosen directory.
Then run the makefile, followed by the executable.
When executing from the command line, the format should be as follows:
	ppmrw <#> <input> <output>
Where <#> is the number for the format you wish to translate to (3 or 6),
input is the name of the input file (e.g sample.ppm), and output is the
name of the file you wish to write to (e.g output.ppm).
Note that the output file must be a .ppm file, or the program will reject it.
